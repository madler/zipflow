// zipflow is a streaming zipper. Names of files and directories, or metadata
// and file data are provided to zip. The resulting zip file is streamed out
// without seeking. The Zip64 format is used as needed. When compiling, link
// with zlib (-lz).

// Basic usage:
//
//      ZIP *zip = zip_open(outfile, level);
//      zip_entry(zip, name_1);
//      zip_entry(zip, name_2);
//      ...
//      zip_entry(zip, name_n);
//      zip_close(zip);
//
// where outfile is an open FILE * in binary mode, level is the compression
// level (-1..9), and name_i are the names of files and/or directories to zip.
//
// To write a zip file entry directly, providing the data and metadata:
//
//      ZIP *zip = zip_open(outfile, level);
//      time_t t = time(NULL);
//      zip_meta(zip, "path-in-zip-file", 3, 0644, t, t);
//      zip_data(zip, data_1, len_1, 0);
//      zip_data(zip, data_2, len_2, 0);
//      ...
//      zip_data(zip, data_n, len_n, 1);
//      zip_close(zip);
//
// where the entry data are the blocks data_i, each with len_i bytes. See below
// for more details on the arguments to zip_meta(). The last call of zip_data()
// has a 1 in the last argument to complete the entry. Multiple calls to
// zip_entry() and zip_meta()/zip_data() can be mixed as desired.
//
// Instead of writing to a file, an output function can be registered by using
// zip_pipe() instead of zip_open():
//
//      int put(void *handle, void const *ptr, size_t len) {
//          return fwrite(ptr, 1, len, (FILE *)handle) < len;
//      }
//      ZIP *zip = zip_pipe(stdout, put, level);
//
// Of course, that also writes to a file, but you get the idea. It could,
// instead, write to a communication channel, or do other processing on the
// streaming zip file data.
//
// Warning and error messages can optionally be captured by a registered
// function. For example:
//
//      void log(void *out, char *msg) {
//          fprintf((FILE *)out, "zip issue: %s\n", msg);
//          free(msg);
//      }
//
//      ZIP *zip = zip_open(stdout, level);
//      FILE *dump = fopen("dump.log", "w");
//      zip_log(zip, dump, log);
//      ...
//      zip_close(zip);
//      fclose(dump);
//
// will write all messages to dump.log instead of stderr.

// Motivation for zipflow: Normally, zip file processing requires random access
// to the zip file on mass storage or in memory. This streaming zipper does not
// require such random access, and does not require that the entire zip file be
// in mass storage or memory at any time. No matter how large the input files
// are or how large the resulting zip file is, the amount of memory used by
// this code for the input and output data, as well as for the compression
// process, is small and constant, less than 800 KiB. Additional memory is used
// to save metadata on the files written to the zip file, proportional to the
// number of files. This is required to be able to write the zip directory at
// the end of the zip file. That amount of memory is equal to a small constant
// plus the average length of a file name, multiplied by the number of entries
// in the resulting zip file. The small constant is 64 to 72 bytes plus the
// null termination and allocation overhead for the file name.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>
typedef void ZIP;           // opaque structure for zip streaming operations

// Return the zip state to write a zip file to out. If out is file, it is
// assumed that the current write position is zero. On systems where it
// matters, out must be in binary mode. level is the compression level for
// deflate, in the range -1..9 as defined in zlib.h. A pointer to the zip state
// is returned on success. NULL is returned if out is NULL or level is out of
// range.
ZIP *zip_open(FILE *out, int level);

// Like zip_open(), but instead of a FILE *, register the function put() for
// the streaming zip file output. put() accepts the len bytes at ptr. If ptr is
// NULL, then the streaming has completed, and put() may flush the output.
// put() returns 0 on success, or 1 to abort the streaming. If put() returns 1,
// it will not be called again for that ZIP * instance. No error message is
// issued in that case. A pointer to the zip state is returned on success. NULL
// is returned if put is NULL or level is out of range.
ZIP *zip_pipe(void *handle,
              int (*put)(void *handle, void const *ptr, size_t len),
              int level);

// Register the function log() to intercept warning and error messages. msg is
// an allocated zero-terminated string containing the message. The user is
// responsible for freeing the allocation. hook is passed to the log() function
// on each call, which can point to a user-defined and supplied structure with
// information used to process the message. zip_log() can be called at any time
// after zip_open() and before zip_close(). The previous log() function can be
// unregistered by passing NULL for the function pointer. When not intercepted,
// the error messages are printed on stderr with an added "zipflow: " prefix
// and new line suffix. On success, 0 is returned. If zip is not valid, then -1
// is returned.
int zip_log(ZIP *zip, void *hook, void (*log)(void *hook, char *msg));

// Add an entry to the zip file with the file path, or entries to the zip file
// with any files contained at any level in the directory path. On success, 0
// is returned. If zip is not valid, then -1 is returned. If there is a write
// error, then 1 is returned. In that event, no further writing will be
// attempted on this stream, and the only viable action is zip_close().
int zip_entry(ZIP *zip, char const *path);

// Prepare to write a new zip entry by providing the metadata for the entry:
// the name path and the operating system os, followed by operating-system
// specific parameters. path is limited by the zip format to no more than 65535
// bytes in length. os must be 3 for Unix attributes, or 10 for Windows
// attributes. See the commented prototypes below for the types. The next call
// must be zip_data() to write the entry data. On success, 0 is returned. If
// zip, path, or os are invalid, -1 is returned. Nothing is written to the zip
// file by this function, so there is no possibility of a new write error.
int zip_meta(ZIP *zip, char const *path, int os, ...);
// Unix:
//      int zip_meta(ZIP *zip, char const *path, 3, unsigned mode,
//                   uint32_t atime, uint32_t mtime);
// Windows:
//      int zip_meta(ZIP *zip, char const *path, 10, uint32_t attr,
//                   uint64_t ctime, uint64_t atime, uint64_t mtime);

// Compress and write the len bytes at data to the current entry in the zip
// file. Complete the entry if last is true. zip_data() can only be called
// after zip_meta(), or after a non-last zip_data() call. On success, 0 is
// returned. If zip is invalid, -1 is returned. If there is a write error, 1 is
// returned.
int zip_data(ZIP *zip, void const *data, size_t len, int last);

// Complete the zip file by writing the zip directory at the end. Close the zip
// object, freeing all allocated memory, including the object itself, which
// cannot be used again after this. This flushes but does not close the output
// file that was passed to zip_open(), since zip_open() didn't open it. In the
// event that there was a write error in a preceding zip_entry(), nothing is
// written, and the zip object is simply freed. On success, 0 is returned. If
// zip is not valid, then -1 is returned. If there is a write error, then 1 is
// returned.
int zip_close(ZIP *zip);

// Error handling notes: All memory allocations are expected to succeed. The
// code aborts immediately with an assert if an allocation or reallocation
// fails. Similarly, the deflate() process and localtime() on the current time
// should not fail, and so assert out if there is an error or unexpected return
// value. If there is a read error on a file after successfully opening it, the
// entry is completed with the partial file data up to the error. However, the
// entry is omitted from the zip file central directory, and a warning message
// is issued. The omission results in the corrupted entry being invisible to
// unzip and other zip file access programs and libraries.
